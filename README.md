# LIBER Data Science in Libraries Working Group 

The [LIBER Data Science in Libraries (DSLib) working group](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-data-science-in-libraries-working-group/) explores and promotes library engagement in applying data science and analytical methods in libraries.

This is our GitLab repository which we'll be using to maintain documents and resources while the WG is active. Feel free to take a look around and open an issue/make a pull request!
